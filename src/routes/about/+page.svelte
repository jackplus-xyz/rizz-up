    is a web application that analyzes user skin tones and generates personalized
    color palettes. The app will accept a user-uploaded photo, analyze the skin tone
    and provide a list of colors that complement the user the most.
    <!-- Users can share -->
    <!-- their results on social media. They can also use image-generation tools to virtually -->
    <!-- dress in their recommended color palette, providing shopping links for easy access -->
    <!-- to those colors in real life. -->

    How Does it Work?
  </h2>
  <p in:fly={{ y: 50, duration: 500, delay: 350, easing: quadInOut }}>
    Color theory is a complex science that involves understanding how colors
    interact with each other. What
    <strong class="italic">Rizz Up</strong>
    does is it will try to find the color that looks the best on you based on your
    skin tone. It may be affected by the lighting in the photo, but it will give
    you a good idea of what colors look good on you. Then you can use this information
    as a guide when shopping for new clothes.

      >Jack Huang</a
    >. I'm a software engineer who's passionate about building tools. You can
    find more of them
    <a href="https://jackplus.xyz/projects" class="font-bold hover:underline"
      >here</a
    >. This project was inspired by a reels on Instagram where I find you can
    get advices from professional stylists in Korea, who will recommend clothes
    based on your skin tone. I thought it would be cool to build a tool that can
    do that for everyone. Privacy is a big cocern for me, so I made sure that
    this app doesn't store any of your personal information. The image data will
    be stored in your browser's local storage for the duration of your visit. It
    won't be stored in any database. (So I don't have to pay for it! üòÇ)

    How is it done?

  <p in:fly={{ y: 50, duration: 500, delay: 450, easing: quadInOut }}>
    The app uses

      class="font-bold hover:underline"
      >a deep learning based cutting-edge facial detector for Python</a
    >
    to determine the facial area, then send it to
    <a href="https://claude.ai/" class="font-bold hover:underline">Claude</a>,
    for skin tone analysis. The result is then used to generate a color palette,
    which you can then:

  <ol
    class="ml-6 list-disc md:ml-4"
    in:fly={{ y: 50, duration: 500, delay: 500, easing: quadInOut }}

    <li>Save the recommended color palette for future reference</li>
    <li>Avoid buying clothes that don't match your skin tone</li>
    <li>Share the results and see what you friends think</li>
    <!-- <li>Explore the shopping links that matches the color</li> -->
